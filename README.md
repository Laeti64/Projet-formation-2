## Concept
This project was about creating a music website, calling an existing API (wildify - created by our teacher) using react, javascript, tailwind.
We worked with agile method with a kanban board and daily points each morning.

Challenges:
  
  - the player had to keep playing while the user change pages
  - the player had to load the correct tracklist according to the music selected by the user
  - work on local storage to save the recently played musics and favorites music
  - group all the API calls
  - the drag and drop to upload musics and update the tracklists

Attention: necessité d'avoir le token api pour accéder à toutes les features

### Tools

- _Concurrently_ : Allows for several commands to run concurrently in the same CLI
- _Husky_ : Allows to execute specific commands that trigger on _git_ events
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, packaging less tools for a more fluid experience
- _ESLint_ : "Quality of code" tool, ensures chosen rules will be enforced
- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
- _ Airbnb Standard_ : One of the most known "standards", even though it's not officially linked to ES/JS
